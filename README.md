# Path-Prediction-TIP-2016

Two test datasets used for evaluation of visual path prediction algorithm. They are used in our paper [1] publicated on TIP 2016. All of the images, videos, and annotations of these two datasets are adapted from two large video datasets, including VIRAT Video Dataset Release 2.0 [2] and KIT AIS Dataset [3]. If you use these datasets in your research, please kindly cite them:

We construct two benchmark datasets for visual path prediction from the adaptation of two large video tracking
datasets [6], [7].
