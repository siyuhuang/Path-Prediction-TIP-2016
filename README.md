# Visual-Path-Prediction-TIP-2016

Two test datasets used for evaluation of visual path prediction algorithm. They are used in our paper [1] publicated on TIP 2016. All of the images, videos, and annotations of these two datasets are adapted from two video datasets, including VIRAT Video Dataset Release 2.0 [2] and KIT AIS Dataset [3].
